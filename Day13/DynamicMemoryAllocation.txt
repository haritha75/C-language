we have two types of memory allocations

1) Static memory Allocation :
   
   -- memroy allocated  in stack area
   -- it decides at compile-time

2) Dynamic memory Allocation :

   -- It allocated in heap area
   -- it decides at run-time
   -- Dynamic memmroy allocation created with either malloc() or calloc() functions only.

malloc() :

   -- it stands for memory allocations
   -- it is used to allocate the memroy space inside the heap area for this purpose we are using
   -- It return void pointer
   -- It does not assigned values intially

   syntax :

   int ptr* = (int*) malloc(n*sizeof(int));


free() :

    -- it is used to free the data from the heap for that purpose we are using this one
    -- it doesnot done automatically
    -- whenever user can called that time only it happend.
    -- whever you donot want the data or free up the data from the heap use this one   



calloc() :
  
  -- it stands for contiguous allocation.
  -- it is also used to create memeory space or size inside the heap
  -- but intially all values intialized to zero 
  -- it takes two parameters  one is how manu values we want and another one is size

realloc() :

   -- it stand s for re-allocation
   -- it is used to resize the previous memroy size for that purpose we are using this one
   -- it is used only malloc or alloc methods creating size that time only we can resize the size.


Null Pointer :

  -- it happend whenever memroy size not allocated perfectly that time it happend
  -- for example you are given size by using malloc() function but size not fit or enough in the meory that time it happends
