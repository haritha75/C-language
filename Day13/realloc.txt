Realloc is used to reallocate the memory, which is already allocated.

This comes across three scenarios:
---------------------------------

1. Allocating more memory than previous memory.
2. Allocating less memory than previous memory.
3. If we want to increase the size of ptr variable, if next memory location is already allocated, 
   then new memory allocated for all values.


If we allocate less memory than previous memory,value in the extra memory or previously allocated extra memory,
won't delete, but it is considered as free space.
